# Friend-finder-app
FriendZone is a friend finding app that helps you connect 
with people that match your personality type by asking 
you a few questions and cross-matching them with our member-database
 to find you your perfect-match.

This app is built by using following technologies:
<!-- Front end /Client side -->
* HTML, CSS 

<!-- Back-end / Server-side -->
* Javascript
* Nodejs
* Expressjs 

How it works? 

A welcome page greets the user and a button [Go-to-survey],
takes the user to another page [on another routindg address]
where user takes a 10-questions survey.
<!-- No-typing required - Just selecting from pre-defined options -->
Then we take the informtaion and cross-examine the results with 
our existing arrays of users and find the perfect match for the user.
